FAQs:

**Q. Health data not showing up**
A: If your health data is not visible in the app, consider the following:

Check Permissions: Ensure that HabitPlus has the necessary permissions to read data from Health Connect. You may need to grant access to health data through the app settings.

Verify Other Health Tracking Devices: If you are using other health tracking devices or apps like Google Fit, make sure they are properly configured to write data to Health Connect. Data from these sources should then be accessible in HabitPlus.

By following these steps, you should be able to view your health data in HabitPlus. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to support for further assistance.
